# [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)

ðŸ’œ Fish is one of the saniest software I've seen.

Almost vanilla [config](/users/shared/.config/fish/config.fish), a lot of faster than zsh/zim bundle with the same functionality.

Minimalistic [prompt](/users/shared/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish) with git integration:

Use `fish-config` to configure it with GUI.

## Fuzzy change directory with zoxide

`j nix` will switch to `/etc/nixos`.
`j Do` will switch to `/home/ksevelyar/Downloads`.

## Fuzzy change directory with FZF

Press `Alt+C`

## Fuzzy find file

Type `v <Alt>-t` or `v -o (fzf)`

## Don't use cd

you can run `/code` instead of `cd /code`
